#  Documentation for `server_ssl_handler` Function

The `server_ssl_handler` function is responsible for accepting incoming connections, wrapping them in SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption, and then returning the SSL-enabled socket for further communication. This function is an essential part of the server-side code that ensures secure communication between clients and the server.

### Function Purpose

The primary purpose of the `server_ssl_handler` function is to establish a secure connection with clients by employing SSL encryption.

### Function Parameters

The `server_ssl_handler` function does not take any explicit parameters, but it is part of a class, so it implicitly takes the `self` parameter, which refers to the instance of the class.

### Function Return Type

The function returns a `socket` object with SSL encryption, representing the secure connection between the server and a client.

### How it Works

1. The function starts by accepting incoming connections using the `self.server.accept()` method. This method blocks until a client connects to the server. When a client connects, a regular non-SSL socket (`non_ssl_conn`) and the client's address (`addr`) are obtained.
    
2. The client's IP address and port information are stored in the `self.client_remote_ip_port` variable for later use, such as logging or information display.
    
3. The function then proceeds to wrap the non-SSL socket in an SSL socket using the `ssl.create_default_context` method. It also loads the server's certificate (`server.crt`) and private key (`server.key`) using the `load_cert_chain` method to enable SSL encryption for the socket.
    
4. Additionally, the function sets the `verify_mode` property of the SSL context to `ssl.CERT_NONE`. This means that the server does not verify the client's certificate, making it suitable for self-signed certificates or testing purposes.
    
5. The SSL socket is created by calling `ssl_context.wrap_socket(non_ssl_conn, server_side=True)`.
    
6. Finally, the function returns the SSL-enabled socket to the calling code, allowing secure communication with the connected client.
    

### Error Handling

The function includes some error handling to deal with potential issues that might arise during the SSL wrapping process or client connection.

- If an SSL-related error occurs, such as an unknown certificate or a wrong SSL version number, the function logs a warning message with details about the error.
    
- If the client disconnects abruptly or encounters a connection-related issue, the function logs a warning message indicating the client's IP address and port.
    
- If the server fails to find the required certificate or key files (`server.crt` or `server.key`), it logs a debug message indicating the missing file.
    
- For any other unknown exceptions, the function logs a debug message with details about the specific error encountered.
