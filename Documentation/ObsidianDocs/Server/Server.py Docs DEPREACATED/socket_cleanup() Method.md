The `socket_cleanup` function is a cleanup routine that ensures the server's socket is closed properly during any type of exit or shutdown. It helps prevent errors and ensures that the resources are released gracefully.

### Function Purpose

The main purpose of the `socket_cleanup` function is to close the server's socket to release resources and avoid any potential issues during the server shutdown process.

### Function Parameters

The `socket_cleanup` function does not take any parameters other than the `self` parameter, which refers to the instance of the class containing the server socket.

### How it Works

1. The function tries to close the server's socket using the `self.server.close()` method to release the resources associated with it.
    
2. A debug log message (`self.Sx02`) is printed to indicate the successful closure of the socket.
    
3. If any exception occurs during the socket closing process, a warning message is logged, indicating the type of exception encountered.
