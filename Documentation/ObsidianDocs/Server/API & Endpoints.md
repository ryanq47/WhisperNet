## All ideas for now

These can be "changed to whatevrr" endpoints you want via a settings file

/server
- All server related things
	- Spawn listeners
	- etc

/agent:
- Where the agents check in. 



Secureity:
- Authentication of some sort eventually

- EVERYTHING returns 200. Even a true 400/404 should return the error page of 404err.txt, which is a 200. this helps prevent stuff from being enum'd from the server
