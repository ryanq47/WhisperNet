The `server_plaintext_handler` function is responsible for handling plaintext communication with clients. It accepts incoming connections, and once a client connects, it returns the regular non-SSL socket, enabling communication without encryption.

### Function Purpose

The primary purpose of the `server_plaintext_handler` function is to establish a basic unencrypted connection with clients, suitable for plaintext data exchange.

### Function Parameters

The `server_plaintext_handler` function does not take any explicit parameters, but it is part of a class, so it implicitly takes the `self` parameter, which refers to the instance of the class.

### Function Return Type

The function returns a `socket` object representing the non-SSL socket for plaintext communication with the connected client.

### How it Works

1. The function starts by accepting incoming connections using the `self.server.accept()` method. This method blocks until a client connects to the server. When a client connects, a regular non-SSL socket (`non_ssl_conn`) and the client's address (`addr`) are obtained.
    
2. The client's IP address and port information are stored in the `self.client_remote_ip_port` variable for later use, such as logging or information display.
    
3. The function then returns the non-SSL socket `non_ssl_conn` to the calling code, allowing plaintext communication with the connected client.
    

### Error Handling

The function includes error handling to deal with potential issues that might arise during the connection process or client disconnection.

- If the client disconnects abruptly or encounters a connection-related issue, the function logs a warning message indicating the client's IP address and port.
    
- If the server encounters any other unknown exceptions, the function logs a debug message with details about the specific error encountered.
