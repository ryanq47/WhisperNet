Left off getting the client to send data over to the server. It works! I still need to:
- [ ] Validate everything is working correctly & is clean/**documented** with sending to the server.
	- [ ] Document revised JSON structure as well.
- [ ] Make sure the server is receiving everything correctly 
	- Note, I created some debug statements that print directly from json data on line 209 of server.py
- [ ] Properly Name the Server.dev. Use [this to do it correctly](obsidian://open?vault=ObsidianDocs&file=Clients%2FCSharp%2FFunctions%20Overview%2FNaming%20%26%20general).
	- Make sure you are using the one in the DEV folder. Need to fix lol
- [ ] Re-organize the Program.cs file & clean it up
