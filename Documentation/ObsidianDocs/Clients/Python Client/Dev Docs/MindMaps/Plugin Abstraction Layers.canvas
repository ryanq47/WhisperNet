They handle the \"big\"/raw actions the code needs to do.

This allows the plugins to be super flexible when they need certain data, etc\n\nIf a handler is only used within a plugin & not needed elsewhere, I generally keep them inside the Plugin file. Otherwise, the handlers are stored as \\<NAME\\>Handler.py"},
