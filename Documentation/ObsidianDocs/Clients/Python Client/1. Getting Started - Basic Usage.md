Welcome to the Python Client! If you've used Metasploit, or Empire, this should feel fairly familiar.


To run:

	python3 client.py


## Basic Usage:

The client consists of "directories". Each directory is essentially, a mini tool (aka a plugin)

When you start the program, you'll be in the "home" directory: 

	home >>

Each plugin has its own set of commands, and typing 'help' should show those commands. Here's 'home's help command: (note, this is an early rendition of the help command, likely to change)

	Help Menu:

        'help'  : Spawns this menu
        'exit'  : Exits the program
        'clear' : Clears the screen
        'plugins' : Shows currently loaded plugins, their paths, and a short description



#### **Accessing other plugins**

The "cd systemshell" command takes us to the "systemshell" tool. This is a plugin that interacts with your local systems CLI. (Note: It's only semi-interactive, so be careful what commands you run.)

	home/systemshell >> 


#### Connecting to Server (not implemented)
The "server" command takes you to the "server" plugin. From here, you can connect to the c2 server, and interact with it.
