## Quick Description
authentication to the Rest & Other endpoints.

Database based

passwords should be hashed, not plaintext
- Need to find best hashng

## Possible Solutions/Plan

DB home: DataBases/users.db


## Left off notes

Left off working on getting the DB connection coded. AuthenticationHandler will talk to the DB classes once that is complete, and then I can hook the APIup to it.
- [ ] DB connector is coded, needs testing & error handling

The methods are there for those 2, just fill them in
