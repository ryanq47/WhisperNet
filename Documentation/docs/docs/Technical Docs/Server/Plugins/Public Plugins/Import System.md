### Import System Methodology

All of the plugins that have a standalone mode use a dynamic import methodology to adjust module import paths based on the execution context â€” standalone or integrated within a larger framework.

At the moment, just the Public Plugins have standalone modes.

#### Standalone Mode:
- When the script runs as the main program (`__name__ == "__main__"`), it operates in standalone mode. In this mode, it uses the default `sys.path` which already includes the directory of the script.

#### Integrated Mode:
- If the script is not the main program, it assumes it's part of an integrated system.
- It dynamically adds its current directory to the start of `sys.path`. This ensures that imports search this directory first before any other system paths. This is particularly useful for maintaining separate environments within a larger application architecture.
  
#### Common Imports:
- After setting the import path, the script imports necessary modules like `ActionLogger`, `Logger`, `Client`, `HTTPJsonRequest`, and utilities. These imports use the adjusted `sys.path` to locate modules whether in standalone or integrated mode.

This approach minimizes import errors and ensures modularity, allowing the same codebase to function differently depending on its operational context.


Example:

```
## Standalone
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Standalone Mode")

## Integrated
else:
    ## Hacky little method to keep one import section, but just tell the 
    ## interpreter where to look for these plugins
    current_directory = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
    print("Integrated mode")
    #("Current directory:", current_directory)

    # Insert this path at the start of the sys.path
    # This ensures that it is the first location Python looks for modules to import
    sys.path.insert(0, current_directory)

## Now, based on the sys.path, the interpreter will know where to look for the correct module.
