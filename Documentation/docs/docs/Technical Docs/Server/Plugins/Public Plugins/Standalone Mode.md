## Standalone Mode

Public Plugins can be run standalone. Just copy the plugin folder wherever you want, and run the following:

```
> python3 ListenerHTTP.py --ip 127.0.0.1 --port 5001 --controlnode 10.10.10.10


```

Note, in standalone mode, plugins need to be manually interacted with (i.e. TTY access of some sort) to control them. You lose the management features in exchange for flexibility/modularity.
