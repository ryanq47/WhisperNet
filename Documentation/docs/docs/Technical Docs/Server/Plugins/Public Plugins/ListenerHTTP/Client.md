## Client Class Documentation

### Overview
The `Client` class encapsulates the functionalities needed to handle responses from and send commands to client machines in a C2 infrastructure. It manages incoming data as responses, allows querying and modifying response data, and manages a queue of commands to be sent out.

Think of it as a client manager, but for individial client instances

### Class Definition

#### `__init__(self, app)`
Initializes a new instance of the `Client` class.
- **Parameters**:
  - `app`: A reference to the application context which might be used for accessing app-wide configurations or services.

#### Properties
- `responses`: A dictionary that stores response objects indexed by their response IDs.
- `command_queue`: A deque (double-ended queue) used for efficiently managing commands.

### Methods

#### Response Handling

##### `set_response(self, response)`
Stores a response in the dictionary using its 'response_id' as the key.
- **Parameters**:
  - `response`: A dictionary representing the client's response. Should contain keys like 'response_id', 'request_id', 'timestamp', 'status', 'result', and 'error'.
- **Example Usage**:

```python
  client.set_response({
      "response_id": "123",
      "request_id": "001",
      "timestamp": client.current_timestamp(),
      "status": "success",
      "result": {"data": "Example result data"},
      "error": {"code": None, "message": None}
  })
```

##### `get_response(self, response_id)`
Retrieves a response by its ID.
- **Parameters**:
  - `response_id`: The identifier for the response to retrieve.
- **Returns**:
  - The response dictionary if found, otherwise `None`.
- **Example Usage**:
```python
  response = client.get_response("123")
```

##### `set_response_subkey(self, response_id, key, value)`
Sets a specific subkey within a response.
- **Parameters**:
  - `response_id`: The identifier for the response.
  - `key`: The subkey within the response to set.
  - `value`: The new value for the subkey.
- **Example Usage**:
```python
  client.set_response_subkey("123", "status", "failed")
```

##### `get_response_subkey(self, response_id, key)`
Gets a specific subkey value from a response.
- **Parameters**:
  - `response_id`: The identifier for the response.
  - `key`: The subkey within the response to retrieve.
- **Returns**:
  - The value of the subkey if found, otherwise `None`.
- **Example Usage**:
```python
  status = client.get_response_subkey("123", "status")
```

#### Command Queue Handling

##### `enqueue_command(self, command)`
Adds a command to the end of the command queue.
- **Parameters**:
  - `command`: The command to add to the queue.
- **Example Usage**:
```python
  client.enqueue_command("reboot system")
```

##### `dequeue_command(self)`
Removes and returns the first command from the queue.
- **Returns**:
  - The command at the front of the queue if available; otherwise, `None`.
- **Example Usage**:
```python
  next_command = client.dequeue_command()
```

##### `peek_next_command(self)`
Provides a view of the first command in the queue without removing it.
- **Returns**:
  - The first command if the queue is not empty; otherwise, `None`.
- **Example Usage**:
```python
  next_command = client.peek_next_command()
```

##### `queue_size(self)`
Returns the current size of the command queue.
- **Returns**:
  - The number of commands in the queue.
- **Example Usage**:
```python
  queue_size = client.queue_size()
```

#### Utility Functions

##### `current_timestamp(self)`
Returns the current Unix timestamp.
- **Returns**:
  - The current Unix timestamp as an integer.
- **Example Usage**:
```python
  timestamp = client.current_timestamp()
```

### Use Cases
This class is used within a C2 server to manage and respond to communications from compromised hosts (clients), track responses, and issue commands. It is critical for maintaining organized, efficient, and timely operations within a network of controlled machines.
