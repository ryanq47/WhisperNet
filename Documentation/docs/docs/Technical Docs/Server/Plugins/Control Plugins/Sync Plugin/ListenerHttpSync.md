### ListenerHttpSync Class Documentation

#### Overview
The `ListenerHttpSync` class is part of the Sync plugin and is responsible for managing and storing JSON data responses into a data singleton. This class specifically handles HTTP listener responses and ensures that data is properly stored and logged.

#### Imports and Dependencies
- **Utils.DataSingleton**: Manages shared data access across the application.
- **Utils.Logger**: A singleton logger used for centralized logging.

#### ListenerHttpSync Class
```python
from Utils.DataSingleton import Data
from Utils.Logger import LoggingSingleton

class ListenerHttpSync:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = Data()
        self.logger = LoggingSingleton.get_logger()

    def store_response(self, response):
        """
        Stores each key-value pair from the response dictionary in the data singleton.

        Args:
            response (dict): The dictionary containing the data to be stored. Each key-value pair in this dictionary will be added to the synced data store.
        """
        if not isinstance(response, list):
            self.logger.error("Invalid response type: Expected a list.")
            return

        # Iterate over each key-value pair in the response dictionary
        for json_entry in response:
            self.data.Listeners.HTTP.add_synced_data(data=json_entry)

        # Log completion of data storage
        #self.logger.info("All data from the response have been stored successfully.")

        # Uncomment to debug print the data store content
        # print("Data in list")
        # print(self.data.Listeners.HTTP.synced_data_store)
```

#### Detailed Method Description

##### `store_response(response: dict)`
This method is designed to take a dictionary response and store its contents into a data singleton used across the application. Each element of the dictionary is treated as a separate data entry and added to a specific part of the data store:
- Checks if the response is a list (expected format).
- Iterates through each entry in the list and adds it to the synced data store using `add_synced_data` method of the data singleton's HTTP listener attribute.
- Logs an error if the response is not in the expected list format.

#### Remarks
This class is a crucial part of how the Sync plugin manages data synchronization across components. It allows for the organized and consistent storage of data from HTTP responses, facilitating easy retrieval and manipulation of synced data within the application framework.
