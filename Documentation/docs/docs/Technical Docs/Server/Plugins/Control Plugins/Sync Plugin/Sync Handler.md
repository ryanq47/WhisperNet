### Sync Handler Documentation

#### Overview
The Sync Handler is a core component of the Sync plugin, responsible for processing JSON responses received from a server or a service. It effectively manages the parsing and distribution of the response data to designated handlers based on specific keys within the response JSON.

#### Dependencies
- **json**: For parsing and generating JSON data.
- **Utils.Logger**: A singleton logger used for centralized logging.
- **PluginEngine.ControlPlugins.SyncPlugin.Modules.ListenerHttpSync**: Manages HTTP synchronization.

#### SyncHandler Class
```python
class SyncHandler:
    def __init__(self):
        self.logger = LoggingSingleton.get_logger()
        self.data = None
        self.handlers = {
            'listenerHTTP': ListenerHttpSync
        }
        self.request_id = None
        self.response_id = None
        self.timestamp = None
        self.status = None

    def parse_response(self, response):
        """
        Parses the JSON response from a server or a service and dispatches data to appropriate handlers.
        """
        # Detailed implementation omitted for brevity

    def _parse_details(self):
        """
        Parses the top-level keys of the response, extracting and storing each in an attribute.
        """
        # Detailed implementation omitted for brevity

    def _parse_result(self):
        """
        Processes the 'result' part of the JSON response by dynamically handling each key-value pair.
        """
        # Detailed implementation omitted for brevity

    def handle_error(self, error):
        """
        Processes errors encapsulated within the 'error' part of the response.
        """
        # Detailed implementation omitted for brevity

```


## Detailed Method Descriptions
### parse_response(response: str)
Parses the incoming JSON string to extract response details and result data. It handles success and error scenarios differently:

On success, it parses individual details and results.
On errors, it routes the error data to the handle_error method for further processing.

### _parse_details()
Extracts top-level response details such as response_id, request_id, timestamp, and status. These are stored as attributes of the SyncHandler object for potential use in other methods or logging.

### _parse_result()
Handles the result part of the JSON response. Each key within the result is checked against a predefined handler dictionary. If a handler exists for a key, it processes the corresponding value using the designated handler class or function.

### handle_error(error: dict)
Logs errors based on the information provided in the error dictionary. It differentiates between known error codes/messages and unknown errors, providing detailed logging for debugging purposes.
