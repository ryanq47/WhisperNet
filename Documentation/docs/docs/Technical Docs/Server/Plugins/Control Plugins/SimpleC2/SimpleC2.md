# SimpleC2 Plugin Documentation

## Overview
The SimpleC2 plugin is a backend component designed to manage network entities, client communications, and listener configurations for a command and control (C2) framework. It leverages Flask for routing API calls and a Neo4j graph database for data storage.

## Imports and Dependencies

- **Flask**: For creating and managing web routes.
- **Flask-JWT-Extended**: For handling JWT tokens for authentication.
- **Logging**: For logging messages and errors.
- **Inspect**: For retrieving current function names for logging purposes.
- **Requests**: For making HTTP requests.
- **JSON**: For parsing and generating JSON data.
- **Custom Modules**: Including `DataEngine`, `Utils`, and `PluginEngine` for handling specific business logic related to the C2 framework.

## Info Class

Holds metadata about the plugin such as `name`, `author`, `endpoint`, `classname`, and `plugin_type`.

## RoleCheck Decorator

A decorator function for route handlers to ensure that the current user has the required role to access the route.

## SimpleC2 Class

The main class that encapsulates the plugin's functionality. It initializes with Flask app object, setting up logging, data handling, and Neo4j database connection. It includes methods for registering routes, managing listeners, and handling Neo4j database interactions.

### Main Methods

- `main()`: Sets up the plugin and registers web routes.
- `register_routes()`: Defines all the web routes and their handlers.
- `connect_to_neo4j()`: Initializes the connection to the Neo4j database.

### Listener Management

Methods for starting and stopping HTTP listeners, listing current listeners, and managing listener configurations.

### API Handlers

Includes placeholders and implementations for handling API calls related to the dashboard, client commands, network and client management in Neo4j database.

## Neo4j Database Interactions

Methods for adding, removing, and updating networks and clients in the Neo4j database, as well as retrieving properties and relationships.

## Example API Routes
 Include link to routes

- Network Management: Add, remove, update, and get properties of networks.
- Client Management: Add, remove, update, and get properties of clients.
- General: Retrieve all networks, clients, or everything from the database.

## Remarks

This document provides a high-level overview of the SimpleC2 plugin's capabilities, focusing on its role within a C2 framework, handling of HTTP listeners, and interactions with a Neo4j graph database.
