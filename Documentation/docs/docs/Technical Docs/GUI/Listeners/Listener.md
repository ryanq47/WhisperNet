Here's a documentation-style presentation of the `Listeners` class, encapsulating its structure and functionalities:

# Listeners Class

## Overview

This class represents a widget within a PyQt or PySide application that manages listener configurations. It integrates with the application's backend to display and modify listener data, handle UI interactions, and manage state changes through signals.

## Imports and Dependencies

- **inspect, json**: Used for debugging and data handling.
- **PySide6**: Provides Qt widgets and tools for UI construction and signal handling.
- **Utils**: Custom utility classes for logging, web requests, event handling, and data management.
- **QtComponents.Listeners**: Dialogs for creating and terminating listeners.

## Class Definition

### Class Listeners(QWidget)

This widget is designed to interact with the application's backend to fetch, display, and manage listener configurations. It includes functionality to add, remove, and update listeners using a tree view.

#### Properties

- `signal_get_all_data`: Signal emitted to fetch all listener data.
- `signal_get_network_data`: Signal emitted to fetch specific network data.

#### Constructor

The constructor initializes the UI components, setups the signal connections, and prepares the widget for interaction.

```python
def __init__(self, parent=None):
    super().__init__(parent)
    self.logger = BaseLogging.get_logger()
    ...
```

#### Private Methods

- `__ui_load()`: Loads the UI from a .ui file and sets up widgets.
- `__q_timer()`: Configures timers for asynchronous operations.
- `__signal_setup()`: Connects internal signals to the respective slots.

#### UI Methods

- `init_options()`: Initializes context menus and options for UI components.

#### Data Handling Methods

- `get_listener_data()`: Fetches listener data from the server.
- `update_listener_tree_view_widget(data)`: Updates the tree view with the listener data.

#### Event Handling

- `on_context_menu(position)`: Handles right-click context menu actions for the tree view.

#### Actions

- `add_listener()`: Opens a dialog to add a new listener.
- `remove_listener()`: Opens a dialog to remove an existing listener.

## Usage

This class is instantiated as part of a larger application and requires a PyQt or PySide event loop to function properly. It interacts with other parts of the application through shared data instances and custom signals for real-time data synchronization and UI updates.
