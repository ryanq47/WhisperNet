Alrighty... Reducing this project down to just the c2/vuln side of things. I love working on the other tools (portscan, etc) but it's a tad bit too much for me to handle at the moment with school + work :) <br>

New Scope: C2 tool with easy exploitation.  <br>
 <br>
  Features: <br>
  
    Previous C2 architecture
    Few Click Exploit Uploads & execution
    Vulnerability scan based on currently installed software 
    [maybe] Fake Webserver/a new HTTP based C&C method.
